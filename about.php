                My name is John McClane, Sr. I was born March 19, 1955 in Plainfield, New Jersey, USA. My father was an Irish-American policeman while her mother was a housekeeper. During my youth, I sadly lost my father and when I became an adult and my mother also lost her life. As I then moved to New York City where I joined the local police. I very quickly met with some success and I therefore earned to be promoted to the rank of lieutenant by my captain. </br> I am always in the bad place at the bad time but I can handle it. <span>Yippie kay yay !</span>
